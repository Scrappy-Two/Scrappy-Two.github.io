				Scrapp is an augmented reality (AR) social media platform that lets users bring their creative ideas to life and share them with the world.

				you can share location-based photos, create group accounts, and explore new and exciting experiences right on your doorstep.
				Whether you're a growing artist, looking to promote your local business, or just looking for a different way to share your travels, Scrapp is the perfect platform for you.

                    <p>
                      Users will be able to utilize two different account styles: Individual and Group.
                      Individual accounts is exactly what it says on the tin: One account dedicated to One user's experience and self expression!
                      Group accounts are geared towards organisations and societies of any scale.
                      Any group, be it your local sports society or youth club, can be managed by a team of users to promote and deliver everything they have to offer!

                      On top of these, our staff will have access to Administrator and Moderator accounts to ensure that the platform is a living service with regular updates and also maintain a safe space for all.

                    <p>
                        Not only are you able to follow your favourite users and scrapbooks, but you are also able to view content based off of location.
                        Users have the option to geotag their posts, which allows you to find local events and history in your home town, on your travels abroad or even for research.
                        Location will also be a driving factor for our augmented reality, take augmented reality tours for example.
