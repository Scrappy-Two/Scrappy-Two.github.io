                <p>
				Scrapp is an augmented reality (AR) social media platform that lets users bring their creative ideas to life and share them with the world.
				Our goal is to provide an interactive platform for users to share content and grow local communities. With Scrapp,
				you can share location-based photos, create group accounts, and explore new and exciting experiences right on your doorstep.
				Whether you're a growing artist, looking to promote your local business, or just looking for a different way to share your travels, Scrapp is the perfect platform for you.

                    <p>
                        Two types of accounts will be available to public users: Individual and Group.
						Individual accounts are the regular form of account that we are all accustomed to. One person has a profile that they customise to
                        express themselves and their interests. Whereas Group accounts can be incredibly versitile,
						they will be geared towards small, independent groups (e.g. startups) and large scale organisations. With the hopes of
                        creating informative and enjoyable scrapbooksâ€¦ We will also have administrator accounts that monitor the platform to keep Scrapp a safe and positive environment.

                        Not only are you able to follow your favourite users and scrapbooks, but you are also able to view content based off of location. This is allows you to find local events and history in your home town, on your travels
                        abroad or even for research. Location will also be a driving factor for our augmented reality - augmented reality tours and such. Based on the geotags associated with scrapbook posts
